In this game, users are able to pay to mint an NFT card with a 4x4 grid. That NFT is actually a memory game that they can play only one time, with only 2 lives (Every wrong match would take away one life). If they managed to get over 3 matches, they would get a reward according to how many matches they managed to make. The reward is incremental according to the amount they decided to pay for their mint.
